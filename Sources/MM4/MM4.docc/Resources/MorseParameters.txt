// It should be possible to parse this, as every atom name comes with the MM3
// atom type. There are always 5 numbers after the names, representing the 5
// parameters. Atoms new to MM4 (5-member ring carbons, etc.) will have to
// interpolate, making an educated guess based on the CCSD value. For example,
// it seems the alkane-cyclobutane bond in the MM3 forcefield was 123-56.
